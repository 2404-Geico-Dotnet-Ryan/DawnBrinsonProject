		○ Big Lodge
		○ Little Lodge
		○ Tiny Lodge 

	• Once a day or time is reserved it is no longer available
	• Review existing reservation (If I have time) 
	• Each user can only reserve up to 7 days if they try to reserve more than 7 it returns a message saying you are requesting more days than days available time (if I have time) 
	• Once you identify the type of user - admin or owner
