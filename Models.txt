Models for my project 


Lodges/Properties 
Reservation System
User 


LC Reservations: 
	- User
		○ Id 
		○ Username
		○ password
	- Lodges/Properties 
		○ Id
		○ Name of lodge
	- Reservation System (idk if this is necessary or should be combined with the Lodge) 
		○ Check Availability
		○ Reserve Dates


User - One user can reserve more than on lodge so 1-to-many
Lodges - Each lodge can be reserved by one user at a time 1-to-1
Reservation System - Not sure what relationship type this would fall into?





Type of Relationships (Multiplicities)
	- 1-to-1 Relationship   // Example one user has one account
	- 1-to-Many Relationship  // Example one actor could be many movies
	- Many-to Many Relationship // A user could have multiple accounts and one account could have multiple accounts. For example, in a banking system you could have multiple accounts and have multiple people on each account.
